'''Austria''' ({{lang-de|Österreich}}) ({{Audio|Österreich.ogg|Österreich}}), officially the '''Republic of Austria''' ({{lang-de|Republik Österreich}}) ({{Audio|Republik Österreich.ogg|Republik Österreich}}) , is a [[landlocked]] country in [[Central Europe]].
It borders both [[Germany]] and the [[Geography of Afghanistan]] to the north, [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] to the east, [[AfghanistanMilitary]] and [[Italy]] to the south, and [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] to the west. The [[capital]] is the city of [[Vienna]] on the [[Danube River]].&lt;ref&gt;CIA map 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of modern Austria date back to the ninth century, when the territory of Upper and Lower Austria became increasingly populated. The name &quot;Ostarrichi&quot; is first documented in an official document from 996. Since then this word has developed into the Modern German word ''Österreich''&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 4&quot;&gt;Brook-Shepherd 4&lt;/ref&gt; meaning &quot;Eastern Realm&quot; or &quot;Eastern Empire.&quot;

Austria is a [[parliamentary government|parliamentary]] [[AfghanistanMilitary]] comprising nine federal states&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie Johnson 17&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of six European countries that have declared [[neutral country|permanent neutrality]]&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson neutral&quot;&gt;Lonnie Johnson 155–156&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the few countries that includes the concept of everlasting neutrality in its [[constitution]]. Austria has been a member of the [[United Nations]] since 1955&lt;ref&gt;Jelavich 267&lt;/ref&gt; and joined the [[European Union]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;CIA par. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Plague''''' (''[[Geography of Afghanistan]].'' '''''La Peste''''') is a [[novel]] by [[Albert Camus]], published in [[1947]], that tells the story of medical workers finding solidarity i
n their labour as the [[Algeria]]n city of [[Oran]] is swept by a [[Bubonic plague|plague]]. It asks a number of questions relating to the nature of destiny and the human condition. The cha
racters in the book, ranging from doctors to vacationers to fugitives, all help to show the effects the plague has on a populace.

The novel is believed to be based in the cholera epidemic that killed a large percentage of Oran's population in 1849 after French colonization.  Oran and it environs were struck by the pla
gue multiple times before Camus published this novel.  According to a [http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/13/10/1459.htm research report] by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Oran 
was decimated by the plague in 1556 and 1678, but outbreaks after European colonization in 1921 (185 cases), 1931 (76 cases), and 1944 (95 cases) were very far from the scale of the epidemi
c described in the novel.  

''The Plague'' is considered an [[existentialist]] classic despite Camus' objection to the label. The narrative tone is similar to [[Franz Kafka|Kafka's]], especially in ''[[The Trial]],'' 
where individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings, the material often pointedly resonating as stark [[allegory]] of phenomenal [[consciousness]] and the human condition. Camus i
ncluded a dim-witted character misreading [[The Trial]] as a mystery novel as an oblique [[homage]].  The novel has been read as a [[metaphor]]ical treatment of the [[French resistance]] to
 [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation during [[World War II]].

Although Camus's approach in the book is severe, his narrator emphasizes the ideas that we ultimately have no control, irrationality of life is inevitable, and he further illustrates the hu
man reaction towards the ‘absurd’. ''The Plague'' represents how the world deals with the philosophical notion of the [[Absurdism|Absurd]], a theory which Camus himself helped to define.

==Plot Summary==
The text of ''The Plague'' is divided into five parts.

===Part one===
In the town of Oran, thousands of rats, initially going unnoticed by the populace, began to die in the streets.  A hysteria develops soon after, causing the local newspapers to report the i
ncident.  Authorities responding to public pressure order the collection and cremation of the rats, unaware that the collection itself was the catalyst for the spread of the bubonic plague.  

The main character, Dr. Rieux, lives comfortably in an apartment building when strangely the building's concierge, M. Michel, a confidante, dies from a fever. Dr. Rieux consults his colleague, Castel, about the illness until they come to the conclusion that a plague is sweeping the town.  They both approach fellow doctors and town authorities about their theory, but are eventually dismissed on the basis of one death.  However, as more and more deaths quickly ensue, it becomes apparent that there is an epidemic.  

Authorities are slow to accept that the situation is serious and quibble over the appropriate action to take.  Official notices enacting control measures are posted, but the language used is optimistic and downplays the seriousness of the situation.  A &quot;special ward&quot; is opened at the hospital, but its 80 beds are filled within three days.  As the death toll begins to rise, more desperate measures are taken.  Homes are quarantined, corpses and burials are strictly supervised.  A supply of plague serum finally arrives, but there is only enough to treat existing cases and the country's emergency reserves are depleted.  When the daily number of deaths jumps to 30, the town is sealed and an outbreak of plague is officially declared.

===Part two===
The town is sealed off.  The town gates are shut, rail travel is prohibited, and all mail service is suspended.  The use of telephone lines is restricted only to &quot;urgent&quot; calls, leaving short telegrams as the only means of communicating with friends or family outside the town.  The separation affects daily activity and depresses the spirit of the townspeople, who begin to feel isolated and introverted, and the plague begins to affect various characters.  

One character, Raymond Rambert, devises a plan to escape the city to join his wife in Paris after city officials refused his request to leave.  He befriends some criminals so that they may smuggle him out of the city.  Another character, Father Paneloux, uses the plague as an opportunity to advance his stature in the town by suggesting that the plague was an act of God for the citizens' sinful nature. His diatribe falls on the ears of many citizens of the town, who turned to religion in droves and who would not have done so in normal circumstances.  Cottard, a criminal fearful of being arrested, becomes wealthy as a major smuggler.  Meanwhile, Dr. Rieux, a vacationer Jean Tarrou, and a civil servant Joseph Grand exhaustively treat patients in their homes and in the hospital. 

Rambert informs Tarrou of his escape plan, but when Tarrou tells him that others in the city, including Dr. Rieux, also have loved ones outside the city that they are not allowed to see, Rambert becomes sympathetic and changes his mind.  He then decides to join Tarrou and Dr. Rieux to help fight the epidemic.

At the peak of the plague's destruction, the townspeople eventually give up on their personal concerns and band together to help each other.  When a child dies from the plague, Dr. Rieux criticizes Father Paneloux's first sermon about God's vengeance for sinful behaviour, citing the innocence of children.  This inspires Father Paneloux to deliver a second sermon, however not to directly address the innocence, but to suggest that death was, in Paneloux's opinion, an expression of God's will. Therefore, the child's death is a &quot;test&quot; for Christians who have to choose between following God wholly or not at all.  Paneloux also implies that all those who died from the plague were sinful.  Then he too was stricken with illness, dying with a crucifix in his hands.

When the plague ends, the townspeople return to their daily routine becoming self-absorbed and ignorant again.  Rambert reunites with his wife; Cottard, not being able to make a living outside of the plague, is captured by the police; Tarrou dies just before the plague ends. Dr. Rieux learns that his wife died from illness though she was outside the city.

==Characters in &quot;The Plague&quot;==

==Characters in &quot;The Plague&quot;==

* '''The Narrator''': presents himself at the outset of the book as witness to the events and privy to documents, but does not identify himself with any character until much later in the novel.
* '''Dr. Bernard Rieux''': The principal character of the novel, though not a traditional protagonist.  He describes himself as tired of the world, but is actively involved in events as a medical professional.  He is among the first to notice the dying rats and human cases of the disease.
* '''Jean Tarrou''': A recent visitor to Oran, apparently independently wealthy.  His diary notebooks provide an additional perspective on unfolding events, recording things seen and overheard accompanied by commentary that is often cryptic.
* '''Joseph Grand''': A municipal clerk of 22 years, passed over for promotion or adequate raise.  As a result of his inadequate means, he lives in a sparingly furnished apartment.  He has difficulty asserting himself and is uncomfortable communicating with others, yet aspires to write a book.  He is a neighbor of M. Cottard.
* '''M. Cottard''': Introduced in the novel just following his attempted suicide, from which he is saved by his neighbor M. Grand.  He is eager to socialize, but has few friends.
* '''Dr. Castel''': An older colleague of Dr. Rieux.  His personal experiences with bubonic plague outbreaks in China and Paris enable him to be the first to recognize the symptoms of the disease and give it a name.
* '''Dr. Richard''': A more cautious and methodical doctor.  He is unwilling to take action to curtail spread of the disease without definitive proof that it is in fact plague.
* '''Father Paneloux''': A Jesuit priest.
* '''M. Othon''': Police magistrate. He has a wife and two children.
* '''Raymond Rambert''': A journalist who, after finding himself isolated within Oran after the plague strikes, embarks upon several escapades with smugglers in an attempt to escape and reunite with his spouse. Following his failure to escape he assists Dr. Rieux in care of plague victims and later joins his wife after being released from quarantine.

==Allusions/references to other works==
In the first part of ''The Plague'', Rieux overhears a conversation concerning an Algerian man being shot to death on a beach. This is in all probability a reference to the plot of Camus's earlier novel ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]''. 

Early in the ''The Plague,'' Cottard refers to [[Kafka]]'s ''[[The Trial]].''
